# Basic-data-exploration-python

The repository contains a basic analysis of data on global terrorism. The database was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd.
I used Python programming language with special libraries: numpy and pandas to analyse the data set, and matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn to visualise them.
You can run my notebook using jupyter-notebook. That's not complicated to install it :)
You should save downloaded data in the same directory as file *.ipynb.
